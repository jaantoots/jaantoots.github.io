\maketitle

This is my personal homepage. This page (and any others, if they ever exist)
also have their source and a PDF version available, e.g.\ \url{index.tex} and
\url{index.pdf}.

\section{About me}

I read for the Natural Sciences Tripos for three years before switching to the
Mathematical Tripos for Part III at Trinity College, Cambridge. I studied
mostly Theoretical Physics but developed an interest for deep learning, and
after a brief period at Oxford (dark blue isn't really my colour) I am now
working with neural networks in the Machine Learning team at
\href{https://veriff.me/}{Veriff}.

Some useful links:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/jaantoots}{GitHub}
  \item \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaantoots/}{LinkedIn} (poorly
    maintained)
\end{itemize}

\section{About other things}

I like well-written, efficient and simple tools. I loathe bloat (incl.\
``design'', JavaScript, etc.) and proprietary software. I occasionally consider
the world to have been a better place before GUIs.

Stuff I like, use or care about:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{http://www.asciiribbon.org/}{ASCII ribbon campaign}
  \item \href{https://www.tug.org/tex4ht/}{TeX4ht} (how this page is generated
    using \texttt{htlatex})
\end{itemize}
