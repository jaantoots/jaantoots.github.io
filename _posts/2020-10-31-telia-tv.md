# Networking setup for Telia TV (using EdgeOS)

This post is about getting full access to Telia TV functionality while using
Telia as the ISP (this is in Estonia but Telia probably have a similar setup in
other nearby countries as well).

I recently decided to set up my home network with my own gear and avoid
anything provided by the ISP on my local network.  However, while the internet
uplink requires a simple DHCP client, the IPTV set-top box only seems to work
with degraded quality and feature set; some channels are not available at all.
There is also an unhelpful error message, saying that these features require
using Telia as your ISP (which is technically correct).

Telia support was ~~extremely helpful and told me what configuration is
needed~~ completely useless and said I would need to use a router provided by
them.  Suffice to say I was not dissuaded and dug deeper.  In the end, I
figured everything out by a combination of looking at the settings on a
friend's router, searching some Estonian forums and a significant amount of
testing to see what works.

## Hardware

-   Huawei [ONU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_optical_network) (provided by Telia)
-   [Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X](https://www.ui.com/edgemax/edgerouter-x/)
-   [Ubiquiti UniFi Switch 8 60W](https://www.ui.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-8/)
-   2x [Ubiquiti UniFi Lite Access Point](https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/)

The [GPON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.984) terminates at a ONU which has a
single Gigabit Ethernet port.  The EdgeRouter has 5 GbE ports: one is connected
to the ONU `eth4`, one to the switch for my LAN `eth0` and the remaining three
I have left for IPTV boxes.  The rest of my LAN setup is not that relevant, but
I have the two access points (using PoE) and everything else connected to the
switch.

I have found Ubiquiti products to be good in general.  They are far from
[perfect](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21430997) but they don't have
any arbitrary limits in software and are overall nice to work with.  The
EdgeRouter X was chosen specifically for this setup for its good feature set
and low cost.  It comes with EdgeOS and is targeted somewhat differently than
the UniFi lineup.  It also does not integrate with their UniFi Controller.
However, in terms of configurability, this is probably an advantage (e.g. it is
not even possible to create virtual WAN interfaces on the UniFi Security
Gateway).

It is also possible to achieve a similar setup with any router running
[OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/).  I would love to use open source firmware but
honestly, I like EdgeOS more and trust it better for reliability and
performance.  (I have focused on EdgeOS below but have actually completed the
same setup with OpenWrt as well.)

## Configuration

-   Internet using DHCP
-   IPTV using DHCP with extra options for static routes on tagged VLAN 4
-   IGMP proxy and multicast firewall rules for IPTV
-   RTSP conntrack for video on demand applications

Actually configuring this in EdgeOS requires familiarity with its CLI (see
[documentation](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008075214-EdgeRouter)).
The configuration is readable and almost beautiful.  Snippets from the
resulting configuration (in `/config/config.boot` and as shown by `show
configuration`) are given below.

### Network interfaces

Internet is untagged and we can use DHCP to get a public IP address for that
interface.  DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation also seems to work out of the box with a
prefix length of 56.  Telia uses tagged VLAN 4 for IPTV access.  The router
will get a IP address in a private subnet using DHCP, but we should not create
a default route on this interface, instead, we will get explicit routes via
DHCP (using option 121 as described in RFC3442).  We probably need to use the
advertised DNS servers on this interface as well.

It is necessary to create a new virtual interface on the interface connected to
the ONU:

```
interfaces {
    ...

    ethernet eth4 {
        address dhcp
        description Internet
        dhcpv6-pd {
            pd 0 {
                interface eth0 {
                    host-address ::1
                    prefix-id :1
                    service slaac
                }
                interface switch0 {
                    host-address ::1
                    prefix-id :2
                    service slaac
                }
                prefix-length /56
            }
            rapid-commit enable
        }
        duplex auto
        firewall {
            in {
                ipv6-name WANv6_IN
                name WAN_IN
            }
            local {
                ipv6-name WANv6_LOCAL
                name WAN_LOCAL
            }
        }
        speed auto
        vif 4 {
            address dhcp
            description IPTV
            dhcp-options {
                client-option "also request static-routes, rfc3442-classless-static-routes;"
                default-route no-update
                default-route-distance 210
                name-server update
            }
            firewall {
                in {
                    name IPTV_IN
                }
                local {
                    name IPTV_LOCAL
                }
            }
            mtu 1500
        }
    }
}
```

As mentioned above, the `rfc3442-classless-static-routes` option is required to
create the table entries necessary for routing IPTV traffic over the correct
interface.  Unfortunately, EdgeOS does not implement anything to actually use
the information in the DHCP response.

Luckily, the format of the response is quite simple (see [RFC3442][1]) and we
can have a custom script that does that in `/etc/dhcp3/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/`
(adapted from [kgersen][2]):

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# e.g.:

if [ -n "$new_rfc3442_classless_static_routes" ]; then
    if [ "$reason" = "BOUND" ] || [ "$reason" = "REBOOT" ]; then
        set -- $new_rfc3442_classless_static_routes

        while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
            net_length=$1
            via_arg=""

            case $net_length in
                32|31|30|29|28|27|26|25)
                    net_address="${2}.${3}.${4}.${5}"
                    gateway="${6}.${7}.${8}.${9}"
                    shift 9
                    ;;
                24|23|22|21|20|19|18|17)
                    net_address="${2}.${3}.${4}.0"
                    gateway="${5}.${6}.${7}.${8}"
                    shift 8
                    ;;
                16|15|14|13|12|11|10|9)
                    net_address="${2}.${3}.0.0"
                    gateway="${4}.${5}.${6}.${7}"
                    shift 7
                    ;;
                8|7|6|5|4|3|2|1)
                    net_address="${2}.0.0.0"
                    gateway="${3}.${4}.${5}.${6}"
                    shift 6
                    ;;
                0)      # default route
                    net_address="0.0.0.0"
                    gateway="${2}.${3}.${4}.${5}"
                    shift 5
                    ;;
                *)      # error
                    return 1
                    ;;
            esac

            # take care of link-local routes
            if [ "${gateway}" != "0.0.0.0" ]; then
                via_arg="via ${gateway}"
            fi

            # set route (ip detects host routes automatically)
            ip -4 route add "${net_address}/${net_length}" \
                ${via_arg} dev "${interface}" >/dev/null 2>&1
        done
    fi
fi
```

However, this is not persistent across reboots and upgrades.  To solve that, we
can use a script in `/config/scripts/post-config.d/` to copy the above file to
the correct place.  Hence, I've put the above in
`/config/scripts/rfc3442-classless-routes` and have an executable file
`/config/scripts/post-config.d/copy-rfc3442-classless-routes`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# copy rfc3442-classless-routes into place

install -p -m755 /config/scripts/rfc3442-classless-routes /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/
```

After rebooting, the `rfc3442-classless-routes` should be copied into place and
the necessary routes added to the table.  This can be checked by `show ip
route` (or a simple `ip r`) and the output pertaining to `eth4.4` should be
something similar to:

```
K    *> 10.0.0.0/8 [0/0] via 10.253.0.1, eth4.4
C    *> 10.253.0.0/18 is directly connected, eth4.4
K    *> 84.50.87.0/24 [0/0] via 10.253.0.1, eth4.4
K    *> 84.50.149.0/24 [0/0] via 10.253.0.1, eth4.4
```

### Local networks and NAT

The rest of the interfaces section deals with my local network(s).  I have
split my other devices and the IPTV boxes onto separate interfaces and subnets,
as the EdgeRouter doesn't have a feature to easily turn on IGMP snooping (more
on that in the [next section](#igmp-proxy)).

I have all my devices connected to a switch which is connected to `eth0` on the
router, leaving three interfaces to be bound together into a single switch
interface (where I have the IPTV box connected to):

```
interfaces {
    ethernet eth0 {
        address 192.168.16.1/24
        description Internal
        duplex auto
        speed auto
    }
    ethernet eth1 {
        description Local
        duplex auto
        speed auto
    }
    ethernet eth2 {
        description Local
        duplex auto
        speed auto
    }
    ethernet eth3 {
        description Local
        duplex auto
        speed auto
    }
    ethernet eth4 {
        ...
    }
    loopback lo {
    }
    switch switch0 {
        address 192.168.2.1/24
        description Local
        mtu 1500
        switch-port {
            interface eth1 {
            }
            interface eth2 {
            }
            interface eth3 {
            }
            vlan-aware disable
        }
    }
}
```

The local networks also require DHCP servers (using dnsmasq for hostname
resolution) and masquerading needs to be enabled for the outbound interfaces:

```
service {
    dhcp-server {
        disabled false
        hostfile-update disable
        shared-network-name LAN1 {
            authoritative enable
            subnet 192.168.16.0/24 {
                default-router 192.168.16.1
                dns-server 192.168.16.1
                lease 86400
                start 192.168.16.38 {
                    stop 192.168.16.243
                }
            }
        }
        shared-network-name LAN2 {
            authoritative enable
            subnet 192.168.2.0/24 {
                default-router 192.168.2.1
                dns-server 192.168.2.1
                lease 86400
                start 192.168.2.38 {
                    stop 192.168.2.243
                }
            }
        }
        static-arp disable
        use-dnsmasq enable
    }
    dns {
        forwarding {
            cache-size 150
            listen-on eth0
            listen-on switch0
        }
    }
    nat {
        rule 5010 {
            description "masquerade for WAN"
            outbound-interface eth4
            type masquerade
        }
        rule 5011 {
            description "masquerade for IPTV"
            outbound-interface eth4.4
            type masquerade
        }
    }

    ...
}
```

### IGMP proxy

[IGMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Group_Management_Protocol) proxy
is needed because the set-top box(es) are on a separate network from the ISP's
servers, and NAT cannot help us here as IGMP operates on the network layer
(like ICMP).  EdgeOS comes with `igmpproxy` and just requires some basic
configuration:

```
protocols {
    igmp-proxy {
        interface eth4.4 {
            alt-subnet 10.0.0.0/8
            role upstream
            threshold 1
        }
        interface switch0 {
            role downstream
            threshold 1
        }
    }
}
```

Somewhat annoyingly, the EdgeRouter does not support [IGMP
snooping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGMP_snooping), which means that
multicast traffic is forwarded to all hosts on the network.  This is a problem
if you don't want to waste bandwidth and especially for any wireless networks.
That is the main reason to have the IPTV boxes on a separate network, and as is
seen above, the IGMP proxy only has `switch0` as its downstream interface,
meaning no IPTV traffic is spammed to my other devices.

### Firewall

Firewall rules need to allow IGMP from the IPTV interface to the router (where
the proxy is running).  Multicast traffic will be simply routed to the local
network, as hosts join a multicast group directly.  The relevant part of the
configuration is the following:

```
firewall {
    ...

    name IPTV_IN {
        default-action drop
        description "IPTV to internal"
        rule 10 {
            action accept
            description "Allow established/related"
            state {
                established enable
                related enable
            }
        }
        rule 20 {
            action drop
            description "Drop invalid state"
            state {
                invalid enable
            }
        }
        rule 30 {
            action accept
            description "Allow multicast"
            destination {
                address 239.0.0.0/8
            }
            protocol udp
        }
    }
    name IPTV_LOCAL {
        default-action drop
        description "IPTV to router"
        rule 10 {
            action accept
            description "Allow established/related"
            state {
                established enable
                related enable
            }
        }
        rule 20 {
            action drop
            description "Drop invalid state"
            state {
                invalid enable
            }
        }
        rule 30 {
            action accept
            description "Allow IGMP"
            protocol igmp
        }
    }
}
```

### RTSP

Finally, the RTSP conntrack module is needed to allow video on demand traffic
through the firewall and NAT.  Luckily, it is present on EdgeOS and enabled by
`set system conntrack modules rtsp enable`.

### Other configuration

There are many more things that can be configured on the EdgeRouter but are not
relevant here.  I would definitely recommend enabling hardware offloading to
get decent performance out of the EdgeRouter X.  While the configuration is
somewhat indirect compared to doing this on a regular Linux distribution, it is
made up by having a single file describe the whole system.

## Conclusion

Everything should be working now, including HD channels, video on demand apps
etc.  Telia's setup actually seems sensible and there is no real reason to
avoid setting things up yourself.

Admittedly, it took me some time to arrive at this setup.  I had initially
planned to use the UniFi Security Gateway but had to change it out for the
EdgeRouter X to be able to configure the system.  Regardless, I am happy with
the result so far.
