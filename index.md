This is my personal homepage. This page (and any others, if they ever exist)
also have a plain text version available, e.g. [index.md](index.md).

## About me

I read for the Natural Sciences Tripos for three years before switching to the
Mathematical Tripos for Part III at Trinity College, Cambridge. I studied
mostly Theoretical Physics but developed an interest for deep learning, and
after a brief period at Oxford (dark blue isn't really my colour) moved out
from academia. I then spent about half a year working with neural networks in
the Machine Learning team at [Veriff](https://veriff.me/). I am currently
building software for autonomous lawnmowers at [Kingdom
Technologies](http://kingdom.garden/).

## About other things

I like well-written, efficient and simple tools. I loathe bloat (incl.
"design", JavaScript, etc.) and proprietary crap.
