This is my personal homepage. This page (and any others, if they ever exist)
also have a plain text version available, e.g. [index.md](index.md).

## About me

I read for the Natural Sciences Tripos for three years before switching to the
Mathematical Tripos for Part III at Trinity College, Cambridge. I studied
mostly Theoretical Physics but developed an interest for deep learning, and
after a brief period at Oxford (dark blue isn't really my colour) I am now
working with neural networks in the Machine Learning team at
[Veriff](https://veriff.me/).

## About other things

I like well-written, efficient and simple tools. I loathe bloat (incl.
"design", JavaScript, etc.) and proprietary software.

Interesting pages:
