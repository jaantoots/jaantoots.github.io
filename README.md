## About me

I read for the Natural Sciences Tripos for three years before switching to the
Mathematical Tripos for Part III at Trinity College, Cambridge.  I studied
mostly Theoretical Physics but developed an interest in deep learning, and
after a brief period at Oxford (dark blue isn't really my colour) left
academia.  I then spent about half a year working with neural networks in the
Machine Learning team at [Veriff](https://veriff.com/).  I have since dabbled
in startups building autonomous lawnmowers and detecting deepfakes, and am
always looking for new challenges.  Currently back at Veriff as a Senior Data
Scientist.
